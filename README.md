# 🌍 ACAW — Autonomous, Composable, Always-On World

**ACAW** is an experimental simulation built on the [Sui blockchain](https://sui.io), designed to be:
- **Autonomous** → The world evolves on-chain without manual triggers.  
- **Composable** → Developers and players can build new modules, assets, and mechanics that plug into the world seamlessly.  
- **Always-On** → The world doesn’t “pause” when you log off — events, agents, and ecosystems keep evolving in real-time.  

---

## 🚀 Vision
ACAW aims to push the boundaries of what’s possible with **Sui Move smart contracts** by creating a persistent, living digital world.  
Think of it as a **self-governing simulation** where code, AI agents, and player actions continuously reshape the ecosystem.  

This project is built to:
- Showcase the power of **Sui’s object-centric model**.  
- Demonstrate composability across modules (economy, politics, resources, AI).  
- Inspire developers, creators, and gamers to imagine new forms of **autonomous worlds**.
